    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "** Support Vector machines**\n",
    "  * Real-world application: Object and face recognition seems to be a very common application where SVMs are used (Old paper but quite relevant - http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~silvio/teaching/EECS598/papers/pontil_verri.pdf. Also - This article talks about face recognition using SVMs - although the focus of article is on a specific technique of preprocessing the image to extract facial components and then run SVM AND compare it with no componentization. (http://cbcl.mit.edu/publications/ps/iccv2001.pdf)\n",
    "  * Strengths: Somewhat resistant to overfitting because only some of the data points that make up the support vectors are relevant in defining the boundary. Also, there is a regularization parameter C that helps in further addressing overfitting. Works well when the n (number of parameters) is relatively small and m (samples) is not very large. n =1-1000 and m = 10-10,000\n",
    "  * Weakness: It does not work too well with large data sets because it is computationally very expensive. Also kernel selection is critical\n",
    "  * Why suitable for this problem set? Given that we have about 49 attributes and the data-set is not large this model may work with this classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** K-NN **\n",
    "  * Real-world application: There are several real world applications of k-NN. Detection of parkinsons disease (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095741741200869X). Large scale e-commerce recommender systems (http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42468255/Recommender_systems_for_large-scale_e-co20160209-8417-1aq0on1.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&Expires=1482292279&Signature=XpcyAIzSAQZIDMw2BXhEl5dNPNA%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRecommender_systems_for_large-scale_e-co.pdf). Anomaly detection such as video based automated security/surveillance systems.\n",
    "  * Strengths: KNN provides strong consistent results. Since it uses a lazy non-parametric algorithm noise in the data does not have a significant negative impact on the performance of the model. \n",
    "  * Weakness: However, because the model is non-parametric it is slower in making predictions for new data and requires that all of the data be stored/accessible, because nearest neighbors will have to be determined for every new data point. \n",
    "  * Why suitable for this problem set? Intuitively, because there are not many parameters in the given data-set, the k nearest neighbors of the new data point may accurately determine how the student is doing in relation to its closest neighbors given the attributes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "** Random Forest Classifier **\n",
    "  * Real-world application: Some applications of Random Forest Classifiers are - Remote sensing (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271616000265). Bio-informatics (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~qyj/papersA08/11-rfbook.pdf) Great video from UBC on the applications of random forest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFGPjRPwyFw\n",
    "  * Strengths: Random forest classifier works well even with high dimensional data or data that parameters of the data that exhibit multicolinearity. It is also fast and effectively addresses overfitting problem of a traditional single Decision Tree. \n",
    "  * Weakness: The problem with Random Forest classifier (or for any DT based model) is that it does not perform very well on regression problems where the predictions can only be made within a certain range. \n",
    "  * Why suitable for this problem set? If this model performs well then it would be easy for the school to understand how the model works and make better use of it. And because it is a non-linear binary classification problem this model may work well. \n"

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",

    "The Random Forest Classifier has been selected as the model to solve this problem. The following reasoning went into making the decision:\n",
    "* Performance - Although the unoptimized performance of Random Forest is not as good as SVM, after some experimentation it was realized that the optimizations to random forest would yield very similar results to the other two approaches with no statistically significant difference in the F1 score on the test sets.\n",
    "* Simplicity - It would be easy to explain the simple model to the school supervisors and ensure that the model gets used. Although the training time is a bit longer, it performs slightly better as compared to the other models in terms of prediction time. Also, the model is fast to train as compared to the other ensemble method - gradient boosting and adaboost.\n",
    "* Resource constraints - The model does not require large storage as compared to K-NN where the data needs to be access to make predictions on every new data point.  \n",
    "* Given that the data set is relatively small and the number of parameters are few the algorithm works very well. However, even if the number of parameters were to grow (as the database is built up over time to collect more information about the students), the algorithm would still continue to work well."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "The Random Forest model fundamentally is based on Decision Trees (DTs). DTs ask set of questions based on the different attributes of the data to arrive at the answer to the question that is being asked. In our case the question is - \"Is an intervention required for the given student\"? For instance, in this case the sequence of questions for a small part of the DT could be something like -  \"Does the student study for more than 2 hours?\" If yes - \"Is the rate of absence more than 3?\" and so on...\n",
    "However, with regular DTs the model does a good job of the training data (that is the data that was used to create the model) where it can perfectly predict the training data. This is an indication that it will fail to generalize for new data/or test data that has not been used to build the model. To address this issue Random Forests Classification modifies the traditional DT model to create many trees instead of one tree. Each created tree is not based on all of the parameters of the data; instead, the attributes are randomly picked to create each tree. For example, in our case one tree might have the \"nursery\" attribute while other tree does not. This helps the algorithm identifying the most important attributes that have an impact on the students passing or not passing. The final result of the model is a much better indication of if a given new student is likely to pass or fail the tests.\n"
